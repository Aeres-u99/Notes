# Notes
I always tend to forget things when I dont use them often, henceforth a simple and short notes collection. 

Aim: 
1) KISS: keep it simple and stupid 

2) Copy paste friendly

3) Easy to understand

4) Weebified is must or else it will get out of my head easily ^_^

5) point 1 is most important

ToDo:

-- pdf? 

-- Kindle syncs somehow (setting up a simple github site for simple access)

-- Add a list of links for good reads/info
