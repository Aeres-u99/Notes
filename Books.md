22:35 <Fenderbassist> good series
22:35 <Aeres> Fafhrd & the grey mouser. I haz kindle and I might go ahead and pirate it for a while.
22:35 <Fenderbassist> by Fritz Leiber
22:35 <Aeres> (blame lockdown :p)
22:35 <Fenderbassist> lool


22:46 <Llamamoe> Coldfire Trilogy, The Dying Earth, The Broken Earth, Beka Cooper, Shades of Magic
22:46 <Llamamoe> Are 5 book series I really really liked
22:47 <Llamamoe> The last two are less unique than the former 3, but good all the same 
22:47 <Fenderbassist> there you go, another suggestion
22:47 <Fenderbassist> that's two series now
22:47 <Llamamoe> Coldifre is dark fantasy about a world where mankind landed a seedship just to find out the whole planet is teeming with what can only be called magic, and are still barely surviving a millenium later 
22:49 <Llamamoe> The Dying Earth is a really peculiar series about Earth whose Sun is close to dying, after dozens of apex civilizations rose and fell, each having left the fabric of reality itself altered. An alien, alien world. What truly shines about it is that it's the best prose I've ever witnessed in the English language. 
22:49 <Llamamoe> If the prose of Dying Earth is 10/10, the next best thing is 4/10 
22:50 <Llamamoe> The Broken Earth is... I feel like its synopsis wouldn't contain any of its true strengths so never mind that
22:50 <Llamamoe> But really good.
