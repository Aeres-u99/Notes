# CTF Study
 # We have started  with picoCTF and finished a lot many 
Tracing path back will be senseless, so start out with picoCTF 2019 and start updating, ofc we can also continue to write about the current adventures. 

Always make sure to make a mind map and things which can help us in remembering the things like HOw we are supposed to think. 

Do we have enough time to re go through bandit? 
We probably do, but going back again and again will only hamper our speed and slow our momentum. Focus on Improving.
